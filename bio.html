        “lt's akin to the ancient art of Bonsai,” explains Bonn O'Brien between sips of house blend at a Brooklyn coffee shop. '‘It takes patience. It takes an eye for detail. It's reverence, respect, and a steady hand all rolled into one. It's the only way to
        take care ofa proper beard. We take the same approach to our music.“
      </p>
      <p>
        Three years ago, the O'Brien—|ead The Dapper Beards burst into the countrys collective consciousness like a Salvador Dali ‘stache thanks to their now—iconic appearance on the cover ofthe trendy periodical "Garden and Gun.” "The Beards Are Here, And They
        Will Save Folk Music” read the headline. The striking image ofthe four bandmates in repose, silhouetted by a SoHo sunset was an immediate viral sensation.
      </p>
      <p>
        "We sued,” says O'Brien with a twist of his mustache, "that's how it went viral. I don't think anyone had seen a bold move like that- a band, suing to protect their image after signing off on the cover. We owe a big thanks to The Smoking Gun for making
        that happen. We had approved the cover, but we hadn't approved of the people who were going to be reading the magazine. Turns out they didn't approach that story with the kind of reverence with which we treat our beards- the same approach we take
        to our music- and we didn't appreciate that."
      </p>
      <p>
        And the Folk pigeonhole? O'Brien didn't take kindly to that, either.
      </p>
      <p>
        "They never took the time to ask for the spelling. It may sound like the word that is commonly used to describe some kinds of roots music, but it wasn't the word that we were using. It's not even the music we're doing. Folk- and that's the only time I'm
        going to use that word- is so over. We're Fauxlk. Pronounced the same way as Folk- which, really, is the last time I'm going to use that word- but it's spelled F—a-u—x-l—k. lfyou're not going to ask us about our music, which we take great care
        in- similar to the way in which we care for our beards- how can we expect
      </p>
      <p>
        The ever—serious O'Brien and his band cared not for the lucky break— a musical outfit landing a cover on one ofAmerica's more respected musical magazines before ever releasing an album or staging a public performance- ifthat break wasn't going to come
        on their own terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        “We take great care in our music, which is also the way we— right, you said it— and we'll be damned ifwe're going to let some media machine run roughshod over us."
      </p>
      <p>
        With the lawsuit now fully behind them (it was thrown out ofthe only court that would hear the groundbreaking piece of litigation— a television courtroom show that is, as its producers kindly reminded us, indeed legally binding within thejudicial system),
        The Dapper Beards are now looking towards the future. l
        <p>
          “We're the foremost representatives of Fauxlk music... the face and beards ofthe movement, if you will. We take that responsibility very seriously, which is the same way in, well, yeah. So, yeah, we're serious"
        </p>
        <p>
          And when will the world get to experience this movement firsthand?
        </p>
        <p>
          "Soon," says O'Brien. "We're thinking about writing our first song, and maybe even playing it at an open mic really soon. But it's not going to be one ofthose slapped—together open mic's, mind you. It's going to be a really serious one."
